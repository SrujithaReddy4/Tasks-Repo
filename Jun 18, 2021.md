  },

      "postalCode": "509216",
      "city": "Shadnagar",
	  "state": "Telangana",
      "countryCode": "IN"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "network": "Github",
      "username": "srujithareddy4",

    "Percentage": "71",
  }],
  "languages": [{
    "language": ["English", "Hindi" , "Telugu"],
    "fluency": "Native speaker"
  }],
}
]

2) how to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
        var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
        var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
console.log(_.isEqual(obj1, obj2));
--> Ideally the output should be true but it is throwing error.
