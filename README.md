JavaScript:
1)It is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website
2)It is used on Client-side.
3)It can run only on browsers.
4)It is used in frontend development.
5)It is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.
6)It can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.

Nodejs:
1)It is a Javascript runtime environment.
2)It is used on Server-side.
3)It code can be run outside the browser.
4)It is mostly used on the server-side.
5)It does not have capability to add HTML tags.
6)It can only run in V8 engine of google chrome.


*******Difference between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2:

HTTP/1:
 1)It loads resources one after the other, 
	  so if one resource cannot be loaded,
          it blocks all the other resources behind it

 2)Synchronous protocol.
 3)HTTP/1 is slow and less efficient than HTTP/2

HTTP/2:
 1)Able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once.
	 So that no one resource blocks any other resource.

 2)Asynchronous protocol.
 3) HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1


******Difference between Programming and scripting language:

Programming language:
1)Code with Programming language takes longer to develop as more code needs to be written.
2)Use Compliation for Exceution.
3)Are complex and tedious to learn.
4)Code run independently of an exterior program
5)Examples : Java, C, C++ etc

Scripting language:
1)Code with scripting language takes less time to code as it needs less coding.
2)Use Interpreter for Exceution
3)Are Compartively less complex and easier to learn.
4)Code run inside another program
5)Examples: JavaScript, Perl, Python etc
